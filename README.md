# pokemon

I found this pokemon dataset on Kaggle because pokemon is so mainstream and is not relevant to just a few - we have all watched an episode or two growing up! I ran few explaratory data analysis and found dragons to possess most strength out of all the other pokemon types and bugs to be the weakest. However, upon further review, I found out that there was a confounding variable at play (legendary status) that had an effect on the pokemon's strength and that maybe pokemon type is not that significantly different in strength after all.
